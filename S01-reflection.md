# How was it?

Thank you for your participation in IHE this semester. Let's take about 10 minutes or so to reflect on what you've done and how the semester has been. 

Feel free to answer honestly. Your responses won't affect your grade but they will be used to continuously improve the Cal State LA student experience for future students.
