# Letters 

Now it’s time for a short writing activity. 

Cal State LA is committed to working together with the local community. Every year we hear from many high school students who are interested in coming to Cal State LA and want to know what it takes to be a successful college student. We think that these high school students would benefit if they received a short letter of advice from current incoming students like you!

We have received many brief messages from high school students requesting advice. Here's on such note:

> STUDENT NOTE [47355]

> Hi Thanks for reading my note and giving advice.

> I am an 11th grader in high school. Ever since the pandemic things have been really crazy for me at home and school. Before the shutdown, I was doing okay in school. But now everything is different and I am struggling to adjust. I just don’t feel motivated to get back to doing things. How do you motivate yourself to get class work done when you don't feel like it?

> Good luck with college. I hope I can join you in a couple of years :)

> From, Jaz
